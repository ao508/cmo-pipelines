# DDP PIPELINE PHI DISCLAIMER

This README file serves as confirmation that there is no PHI (protected health information) data in the DDP test data files.

All data for running the DDP pipeline unit tests and integration tests are mocked and not based on any real patient information. This includes all dates of birth, deceased dates, diagnosis and treatment information, and patient identifiers. All cancer diagnosis codes were taken from [OncoTree](http://oncotree.mskcc.org/) and assigned randomly to the mocked patient data.
